Hello and welcome to my website! 

My name is Lucas, and I am a first-year Computer Science Master's student at ETH Zurich. Previously, I studied at Northwestern University, earning a BS in Computer Science and a BM in Double Bass Performance. My main interests revolve around HCI and NLP, with an interest of integrating music in my work. 

I've done work at D ONE (a leading Swiss data analytics consultancy) and NASA's Scientific Visualization Studio. I was also a research assistant at Northwestern's tiilt Lab under Professor Marcelo Worsley (computational learning sciences) and did a Senior Honors Thesis advised by Professor Rob Voigt. I've presented in two conferences: the 2021 AGU Fall Meeting and the 2024 ACL Conference. 

Away from my monitor, I play the double bass (AKA that really big violin) and studied it during my undergrad. I'm mainly classically trained with orchestral experience (at Northwestern, Aspen Music Festival, and many gigs on the side), but I also love playing solos, jazz, and other instruments like the trombone. Another big hobby of mine is learning languages which in my opinon makes traveling to countries that speak the languages you're learning twice as cool ;\) 

But anyway that's enough about me -- feel free to explore and/or reach out if you'd like!
